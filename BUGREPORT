BUG REPORT: 

1) StringToTokenArray function in file util.c doesn't work correctly if the array that is passed has a different size that the count ... can we remove the int count parameter? This needs more testing and updates.(Jan 7th, 2020)

2) The dealloc_cb in fifo_free(... , ....) function needs to be more robust. Throws warning on building tests, will throw when used later. (Jan 7th, 2020)

3) Need to make sure mock_lidar quits completely. IMPORTANT




RESOLVED:
